# Auto-Deployment Setup for Netlify

This guide will help you set up automatic deployment so that any changes made to your Student Management System will automatically go live on Netlify.

## üöÄ Quick Setup (Recommended Method)

### Step 1: Install Git
1. **Download Git**: Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. **Install**: Run the installer with default settings
3. **Restart**: Close and reopen your terminal/PowerShell

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository
1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com
2. **Sign in** or create account
3. **Click "New Repository"** (green button)
4. **Repository name**: `student-management-system`
5. **Make it Public** (so Netlify can access it)
6. **Click "Create Repository"**

### Step 3: Upload Your Code
1. **Open PowerShell** in your project folder
2. **Run these commands**:

```bash
cd C:\Users\super\student-management
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Student Management System"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/student-management-system.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 4: Connect to Netlify
1. **Go to Netlify**: https://app.netlify.com
2. **Click "New site from Git"**
3. **Choose GitHub** as provider
4. **Select your repository**: `student-management-system`
5. **Build settings**:
   - Build command: (leave empty)
   - Publish directory: (leave empty - it will auto-detect)
6. **Click "Deploy site"**

## üîÑ How Auto-Deployment Works

Once set up:
1. **I make changes** to your code
2. **I commit and push** to GitHub
3. **Netlify automatically detects** the changes
4. **Netlify rebuilds and deploys** your site
5. **Your website updates** within 1-2 minutes!

## üìÅ Files I'll Create

I'll create these files to help with deployment:

- `.gitignore` - Tells Git what files to ignore
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration
- `deploy-instructions.md` - Detailed setup guide

## üõ†Ô∏è Alternative: Manual Upload Method

If you prefer not to use Git:

1. **Make changes** to your files
2. **Zip the entire folder** (except node_modules)
3. **Drag and drop** to Netlify dashboard
4. **Site updates** immediately

**Next Steps**: Once you have Git installed and GitHub repository created, I'll help you push the code and connect it to Netlify for automatic deployment.

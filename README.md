## File Structure

```
student-management/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html           # Main HTML structure
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css           # All styling and responsive design
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js            # Frontend JavaScript with API integration
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js            # Node.js backend server
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json         # Node.js dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ students-data.json   # Database file (auto-generated)
â””â”€â”€ README.md            # This file
```

## Data Storage

The application uses a JSON file (students-data.json) to persist data on the server. To manage data:
- **View Data**: Open `students-data.json` in any text editor
- **Backup Data**: Copy the `students-data.json` file
- **Clear Data**: Delete `students-data.json` and restart the server
- **Export Data**: The JSON file can be imported into any database

## Notes

- Profile pictures are stored as base64 encoded strings in the JSON database
- Maximum image size is 5MB
- Students must be at least 3 years old
- Roll Numbers and Admission Numbers must be unique across all students
- Validation happens both client-side (instant feedback) and server-side (data integrity)
- Server must be running for the application to work

## Future Enhancements

Possible additions for future versions:
- Edit student information
- Delete students
- Search and filter functionality
- Export data to CSV/PDF
